A quick little set of methods for SCALE depletion - avoids using built in TRITON process.


HOW IT WORKS

1 - Runs TRITON for 1 step and kills it afterwards.
2 - Does a predictor step in ORIGEN to t+dt using fluxes, power defs, and the f33 from the first step.
3 - Runs TRITON at t+dt with the new nuclide vector from the EOS at Step 2 - again kills after completing step 0.
4 - Corrector method in Origen using modified f33
