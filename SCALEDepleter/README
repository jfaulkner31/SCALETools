A quick little set of methods for SCALE depletion - avoids using built in TRITON process.


HOW IT WORKS

1 - Runs TRITON for 1 step and kills it afterwards.
2 - Does a predictor step in ORIGEN to t+dt using fluxes, power defs, and the f33 from the first step.
3 - Runs TRITON at t+dt with the new nuclide vector from the EOS at Step 2 - again kills after completing step 0.
4 - Corrector method in Origen using modified f33

OPTIONS FOR DEPLETION
=====================

=====================
CELI
Constant Extrapolator Linear Interpolator
How it works:
  Get A0 at t0 using MC
  Constant extrapolator step: Use A0 to deplete from t0 to t1 - get N1
  Get A1 at t1 using MC
  Linear interpolator step: Deplete from t0 to t1 using a linear interpolator between on t0, t1, A0, A1 (based on number of 'substeps')
  Go to next timestep.

How it works using relaxation factors:
  Get A0 at t0 using MC
  Constant extrapolator step: Use A0 to deplete from t0 to t1 - get N1
  Get A1_0 at t1 using MC
  For every iteration k; k=0; k++:
    Linear interpolator step: Deplete from t0 to t1 using a linear interpolator between on t0, t1, A0, A1_k (based on number of 'substeps') = get N1_k+1
  Averaging step: N_1 =
  Go to next timestep.

Variables:
  origen_predictor_divs - this variable controls the number of divisions in the origen calculation. For CRAM methodology typically the accuracy is not strongly dependent on the number of divisions so using a low number - 1 or 2 is rather fine.
  origen_LI_divs - this is the number of substeps we perform - e.g. how often A0 is interpolated during the
  relaxation - boolean whether to use relaxation and iteration
  relaxation_steps - number of steps to use in the scheme
  relaxation_factor - this is the constant relaxation factor when iterating the linear interpolator
